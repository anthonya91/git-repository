# Indeed COVID-19 Webscraping and Data Analysis Project

This project was done to display my ability and understanding of the following tools:
  - Selenium
  - Beautiful Soup
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

Using these tools I was able to scrape 5,000 job postings from Indeed.com along with the following:
  - Job Title
  - Company
  - Location
  - Salary
  - Summary
  - Requirements
 
 I was then able to create a DataFrame utilizing this data to further clean, analyze and normalize the data
 to answer various questions such as:
 
1. What jobs are most prevalent during COVID?
2. which Locations have a need for employment due to COVID?
3. which Companies are hiring the most in relation to COVID?
4. What are the salary expectations for these jobs?
